# Proposals for Wish Family

This repository contains all project proposals for the wish family and the rules for submitting and examining proposals

## Guidelines
- All members of the wish family have full and equal rights to submit and approve proposals
- All collaboration mechanisms should be written out so that the final solution can be determined after everyone has made a decision, not a gentlemen's agreement
- All community members should be honest and live in harmony with others
